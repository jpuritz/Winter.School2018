# BG4-2018

This page contains the material for "Theory and methods of RNA-seq studies", Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics 2018.


The material is arranges in 3 folders:

Slides, containing the slides in pdf format;

code, containing the code of the tutorials;

results, containing the output of the tutorials in html and pdf files.


We can import the output from the server to our computer via scp (on Mac computers at least); ex. code to import the quality_control output files in our current local directory:

scp -r  USER_NAME@gdcsrv1.ethz.ch:ex_1/quality_control .

You can use https://htmlpreview.github.io/ to view the html files in the quality control (ex. 1).

The multiqc_report.html file is too heavy though: you can download it from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e4LDSg7FainEJ0bEQKJmEVcA-Eopntcz.
